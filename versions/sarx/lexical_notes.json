Agathosyne is not much different, for it also seems ready to do good. But it differs in that it can be more harsh and with a countenance wrinkled by strict standards for one to do well and to excel in what is demanded, without being pleasant to associates and attracting crowds by its sweetness. Also the followers of Zeno define it as follows: agathosyne is a virtue which is beneficial, or a virtue which promotes usefulness, or a virtue for its own sake, or a disposition which is the source of all benefits.\"\n\n> Rather than being a virtue that refers only to a person's words and countenance, chrestotes refers to a virtue that pervades and penetrates the whole nature, that mellows anything harsh and austere. Thus wine that has been mellowed with age (Luke 5:39) is chrestos, and Christ's yoke is chrestos, because it has nothing harsh or galling about it (Matt. 11:30). Cocceius distinguished chrestos and agathosyne this way: \n\n> From this example it is dear that this word [chrestotes] indicates a certain generosity and eagerness to do good. The other word [agathosyne] implies kindness, agreeableness of manners, eloquence, earnestness of character, and every amiability joined with propriety and dignity.\n\n> Even that statement, however, is not exactly correct. If the words are contrasted, kindness belongs more to the chrestotes than to the agathosyne. Jerome's excellent statement is more germain to the matter:\n\n> Benignitas [friendliness! or suavitas [kindness]since among the Greeks chrestotes signifies each, is a gentle, charming, and calm virtue, suited to the company of all good people, attracting their friendship, delightful in encouragement and moderate in manners. Also the Stoics define it thus: chrestotes is a virtue willingly ready to do good. Agathosyne is not much different, for it also seems ready to do good. But it differs in that it can be more harsh and with a countenance wrinkled by strict standards for one to do well and to excel in what is demanded, without being pleasant to associates and attracting crowds by its sweetness. Also the followers of Zeno define it as follows: agathosyne is a virtue which is beneficial, or a virtue which promotes usefulness, or a virtue for its own sake, or a disposition which is the source of all benefits.\n\n> Jerome's statement essentially agrees with the distinction drawn by Basil: \"I think chrestotes is more extensive in doing good to those who in any way at any time have need of it; agathosyne is more narrow and uses words of justice in its well-doing.\" Lightfoot found more activity in the agathosyne than in the chrestotes:\"They are distinguished from one another as character from activity; chrestotes is potential agathosyne, while agathosyne is energizing chrestotes\" \nA man may display his agathosyne, his zeal for goodness and truth, in rebuking, correcting, and chastising. Although Christ was still in the spirit of this virtue when he drove the buyers and sellers out of the temple (Matt. 21:13) and when he uttered all those terrible words against the scribes and the Pharisees (Matt. 23), we could not say that his chrestotes was shown in these acts of righteous indignation. Rather, his chrestotes was displayed in his reception of the penitent woman (Luke 7:37-50; cf. Ps. 25:6-7) and in all his other gracious dealings with the children of men. Thus we might speak of the chrestotes tes agathosynes of God, but scarcely of the converse. This chrestotes was so predominantly a part of the character of Christ's ministry that it is not surprising to learn from Tertullian how \"Christus\" became \"Chrestus\" and \"Christiani\" became \"Chrestiani\" on the lips of the heathen, though with an undertone of contempt. The world expresses contempt for goodness that seems to have only the harmlessness of the dove and not the wisdom of the serpent. Such a contempt would be justified for a goodness that has no edge, no sharpness, no righteous indignation against sin or willingness to punish it. Sometimes chrestotes degenerated into this and ended up being not goodness at all, as evidenced in this striking fragment of Menander: \"What now by some is called kindness [chrestotes] has set loose entire lives to vice, for no one is punished for his wrongs.\"",

In classical Greek, erotao never means \"to ask\" but only \"to interrogate,\" or \"to inquire.\" Like rogare (inquire), erotao implies an equality between the one who asks and the one who is asked as a king with another king (Luke 14:32)or if not equality, then a familiarity that lends authority to the request.\"\n\nMoulton in Proleg. p 160 quotes Mayor who makes the case that the middle voice \"implies using the words, without the spirit, of prayer\" and continues \"For the alternation of active and middle in the Herodias story, Blass's ingenious remark may be recalled, that \"the daughter of Herodias, after the king's declaration, stands in a kind of business relation to him\".\n",
